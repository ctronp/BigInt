# Small library for Big Integers

This project is unfinished, if you want to support or help with the development it is not necessary to write me,
you can make use of the project as you wish.

made for simple usage where pure C is the safest option.

# Usage

just download and add [BigInt.h](BigInt.h) and [BigInt.c](BigInt.c) as
a static library. It will compile to target with at least 16 bits.

# Functions

All the function can be seen in [BigInt.h](BigInt.h),
they are commented about the usage.

# Compilation

compiling with -O2 or -O3 will increase the performance
considerably. usable with -flto and -Ofast.
