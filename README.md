# Small library for Big Integers

made for simple usage where pure C is the safest option (this app still under development).

# Usage

just download and add [BigInt.h](BigInt.h) and [BigInt.c](BigInt.c) as
a static library. It will compile to target with at least 16 bits.

# Functions

All the function can be seen in [BigInt.h](BigInt.h),
they are commented about the usage.

# Compilation

compiling with -O2 or -O3 will increase the performance
considerably. usable with -flto and -Ofast.
